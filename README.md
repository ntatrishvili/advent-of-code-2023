# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions - C#

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges for the year 2023. Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve programming puzzles and challenges that are released daily leading up to Christmas. It's a fun way to improve problem-solving skills and explore different programming languages.

## Motivation
I decided to take up the Advent of Code challenge this year using C# because it's a language I used to be proficient in, and I wanted to revisit and enhance my skills with it. This project serves as a personal journey to solve each day's problem and to showcase my problem-solving approach in C#.

## Structure
- **`Program.cs`**: The main C# file containing the solutions for each day's challenge.
- **`1_input.txt`**: Sample input file for the challenges.

## How to Run
To run the solutions, you can simply execute the `Main` method in `Program.cs`. The program reads input data from the `1_input.txt` file and outputs the results to the console.

Feel free to explore the code and solutions for each day's challenge. I hope you find this project interesting and informative!

Happy coding!
